### 👨‍💻 EduTech, AI and Blockchain Service Developer 👋

Hello. I'm **Yoonsung Jeong (Alec J)**, a developer striving on multiple fronts.

After earning a master's degree in blockchain research and development in graduate school, I'm currently planning and developing new AI-based edu-tech services. And also, I'm always considering convergence with blockchain as needed.

While my main work area is frontend development, I also challenge myself in various fields such as design and backend development.

I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and handling data. Additionally, my advantage lies in my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and technologies based on my experience.

Thank you!
