### 👨‍💻 EduTech, Blockchain and AI Service Developer. 👋

Hello. I'm **Yoonsung Jeong (Alec J)**, a developer striving on multiple fronts.

After studying blockchain and obtaining a master's degree in graduate school, I am currently planning and developing a new edu-tech service that combines Al and blockchain.

While my main focus is on frontend development, I also challenge myself in various fields such as design and server development.

I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and handling data. Additionally, my advantage lies in my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and technologies based on my experience.

Thank you!
