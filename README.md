### Hello, I am a Frontend developer, Yoonsung, Jeong (Alec). ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I studied and developed blockchain in graduate school, got master's degree, and am currently working as a frontend developer at a company specializing in blockchain. I like to learn new technologies, and also I'm a fast learner. I hope to see blockchain applied in various ways in the future, and I intend to work diligently in this area.
